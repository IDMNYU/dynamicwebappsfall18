## Day 9

* Node.js vs Express: a quick note

* Learning Logs Presentations: Alex and Chris

* Examples of good README files

    * [Example node gitignore](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Node.gitignore)
    
* Using npm

* Building a Twitterbot!


### Homework

* Begin working on your midterm project proposal:

    * You will be building a bot. It could be a Twitterbot or work with another messenger. Think hard about the content. What do you want your bot to do? Why? Does it serve a purpose? Possible purposes could be political messaging, creating a useful tool, artistic expression, etc. The point is you know *what* you are making and *why* you are making it. DUE DATE: Oct 16
    
    * Be prepared to pitch your idea to the class and receive feedback on Thursday. You are welcome to mock up an idea to demo during this presentation. Hint: if you can complete this project before the presentation, is is likely not complicated enough, and you should scale it up. Expand your thinking!
    
    * Don't want to use Twitter? Look into [building a bot with Slack and node.js](https://scotch.io/tutorials/building-a-slack-bot-with-modern-nodejs-workflows) or a [Facebook messenger bot with node.js](https://github.com/Charca/bootbot). You may work with another similar service if you like, as long as you are able to get and post data.
    
* My Twitterbot lecture is highly borrowed from Dan Shiffman's! He has a ton of amazing resources and examples on [this page.](https://shiffman.net/a2z/twitter-bots/)

* Read [this article](http://nymag.com/selectall/2015/11/12-weirdest-funniest-smartest-twitter-bots.html) on amazing Twitterbots from NY Mag

* Resource: Another great synchronous vs asynchronous [JS article with examples](https://medium.com/@siddharthac6/javascript-execution-of-synchronous-and-asynchronous-codes-40f3a199e687)
