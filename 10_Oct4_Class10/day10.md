## Day 10

* Learning Log: Joanna

* Backing up: What makes something a bot?

* More examples of Twitterbots, bots from other chat services

* Short demo: Building a Twitterbot that can post on an interval 

* Round Robin: Bot proposals


### Homework

* Begin sketching out your proposed bot, taking into consideration any feedback you may have received in class. Figure out what you need to make your project a success. Come to our next class with questions! 

* In the meantime, I highly suggest Learning Logs that help solidify your understanding of:

    * Asynchronous JS
    
    * Node.js + third party APIs
    
I recommend you save tutorials that deal specifically with node.js + Express until after the midterm, since we are not using Express for this project.
