### Homework

* Let's build something with socket.io! The sky is the limit here. You can choose to:

    * Build on the chat app, taking one of the homework suggestions [at the bottom of the page](https://socket.io/get-started/chat)
    
    * Build a collaborative drawing game, inspired by the tutorial but with your own twist
    
    * Build anything cool you imagine that involves back-and-forth communication between more than one user
    
* Come in Thursday with an idea and a basic framework of how you will build. We will workshop your ideas in class on Thursday and present them in class the following Tuesday, 11/20.
