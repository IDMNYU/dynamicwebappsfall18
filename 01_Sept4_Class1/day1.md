## Welcome to Day 1!

* Introductions

* What is a Dynamic Web App?

* What are we doing in this class?

* Learning Goals:
  * Why am I in this class? Why have I chosen to be sitting here NOW?
  
  * What do I hope I will learn?

  * What are my goals?
  
  * What content do I think will help me accomplish my learning goals?
  
* Go over syllabus & class requirements. This is a contract between students + professor, so it is important we're all on the same page!

* Javascript Assessment 

### Homework: 

1. Find a compelling web app. Test it, try to find its weaknesses. Decide why you like it. Decide what you’d improve upon. Put together a 5-min presentation on this app. This presentation will count toward your class presentation points.

2. Complete one [Learning Log](https://github.com/IDMNYU/dynamicwebappsfall18/blob/master/learninglogs.md) that will assist you as a refresher on the prerequisites for this class. Think about what you learned in the Intro class. Think about what you may have forgotten. Do you remember HTML/CSS? Did the Javascript Assessment reveal any gaps in your knowledge? If you feel fully up to speed, you may try an extension of one of these topics.
