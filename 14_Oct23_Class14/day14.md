## Day 14

* Learning Log: Hung

* Web app with routes demo

* String Patterns + exercise

* FS module + reading and writing JSON data

### Homework

Set up a simple Express app that allows for the following:

* Variable routes that save data to a JSON file

* A route that allows the user to view the entire contents of the JSON file

* If you would like to use P5 to allow for a front end of your app, you may, but you are not required to. We are going to look at specific front-end templating engines that work with Express in the near future.

* Push your app to Github using a Gitignore file that ignores your node_modules, and submit the link to your repo via NYU Classes.
