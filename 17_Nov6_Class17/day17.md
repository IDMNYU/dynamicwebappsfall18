## Day 17

* Learning Log: Sawyer

* Gallery Walk: Simple API apps

* 4 volunteers to demo their app

* Integrating FS and EJS forms: demonstration


### Assignment

* Add a sign up page to your API app that requires user input that is written to a JSON or a txt file. (In this case, used as a miniature databse.) You can decide what user input you require (name/email/password, email/password, etc.). As an added bonus, you could add a route that allows users to sign up then a second page that allows them to login, checking their information against what is written in the database.

Submit a link to a new Github directory, complete with a README, under Assignment #7 on NYU Classes.
