## Day 17

* Learning Log: Sawyer

* Gallery Walk: Simple API apps

* 4 volunteers to demo their app

* Integrating FS and EJS forms: demonstration

### Let's talk about voting

* If you are registered to vote in New York, VOTE TODAY

* If you are registered in another state, I hope you filed an absentee ballot.

* If you are not able to vote in the U.S., you are still effected by the policies the government makes. 

* What you can do now:

    * GO TO YOUR VOTING PLACE AND VOTE
    
    * Find 2 other people at IDM who are registered to vote in NY but have not yet cast their vote.
    
    * Call 2 friends or relatives in other states and remind them to vote.
    
    * If you can prove you engaged in any of this activity, I will give you a free extension of one class period on any assignment. (This applies to old assignments and upcoming assignments.)

### Assignment

* Add a sign up page to your API app that requires user input that is written to a JSON or a txt file. (In this case, used as a miniature databse.) You can decide what user input you require (name/email/password, email/password, etc.). As an added bonus, you could add a route that allows users to sign up then a second page that allows them to login, checking their information against what is written in the database.

Submit a link to a new Github directory, complete with a README, under Assignment #7 on NYU Classes.
