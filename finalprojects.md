## Final Projects

You are now equipped with skills to build a variety of web applications. In this class we have built front-end applications, automated bots, input-output apps, and apps that use real-time communication. 

Your final project must be a web application that has client-server communication. You can opt to build something new or to revist an old project and build upon it to make it more polished.

Your final projects do not need to be deployed to a third-party server, although you are welcome to take this step.

You are welcome to work with a partner. If you do, you must demonstrate an equal collaboration in your presentation.

Final Project Criteria:

* Fully functioning client-server application

* Code executes intention of the app

* Some design thought has been put into the front end

* App is presented in a formal presentation that demonstrates process, working app, and code. (6 minutes to present, 4 minutes for clarifying questions and feedback.) Your app should be pushed to Github with an instructional README that tells other developers a) what the app does and b) how to install and run locally, including any dependencies.

NOTE: All projects are due on December 11, regardless of presentation schedule.
