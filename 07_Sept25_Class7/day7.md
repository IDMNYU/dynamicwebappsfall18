## Day 7

* Learning Logs presentations: Carolyn and Jorge

* Anything you'd like to demo from the homework?

LOTS OF HELPFUL LINKS AND A GRABBAG OF INFO WE NEED FOR TODAY:

* [What is an HTTP Request?](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/http-requests)
    
    * [HTTP Messages](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Messages)
    
    * [HTTP Basics](http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/webprogramming/http_basics.html)
    
* [CORS Errors](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS/Errors)

    * [CORS Errors with Chrome](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/xhr)
    
    *[Same Origin Policy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same-origin_policy)
    
* [Setting Up A Local Testing Server](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/set_up_a_local_testing_server)

* [Fetch vs. XMLHTTP requests](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/03/introduction-to-fetch)

    * In-class example first as XMLHTTP, then converted to fetch: [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Fetching_data)
    
* What is an API?   

* What is an API [in plain English, please](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/what-is-an-api-in-english-please-b880a3214a82)
    
* [History of APIs](https://history.apievangelist.com/)

* HIGHLY RECOMMENDED RESOURCE: [JSON Formatter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/json-formatter/bcjindcccaagfpapjjmafapmmgkkhgoa?hl=en)

* In-class exercise: [Using fetch to grab data from a third party API](https://scotch.io/tutorials/how-to-use-the-javascript-fetch-api-to-get-data)

    * [An awesome follow up to do on your own if you're looking for another tutorial](https://css-tricks.com/using-fetch/)
    

### Homework

* (Assignment #4 on NYU Classes) Find a third party API of your choosing and set up a simple HTML page that uses fetch to grab some data and display it, similar to our in-class exercise. Not sure what API you want to use? [Here is a ridiculously long list](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis)
YOU MAY DO THIS ASSIGNMENT WITH A PARTNER. If you do, make sure you each have a copy of the code and submit it separately via NYU Classes, so I can give you both credit.

* I HIGHLY recommend you do a learning log on fetch and/or APIs this week. There are some excellent resources in the links above.
