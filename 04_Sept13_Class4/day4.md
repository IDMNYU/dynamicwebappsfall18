## Day 4

3-4 volunteers to show their word guesser game

More foundational JS:
* Double == vs triple === in conditionals

* Functions as variables

* JS objects

* Easing into ES6
  * More on ```const``` vs ```let``` vs ```var```

Git and Github review

* You will be expected to push your assignment code to your Github repo on a regular basis. This is how you will be documenting your work in this class.

### Homework

* Edit your Word Guesser/Hangman game to be object oriented and more advanced. For this assignment, please submit two links: A link to your web-based text editor (repl, jsfiddle, etc) AND a link to the Github repo where you have pushed this code. Click over to NYU Classes for the grading breakdown. 
  
  * The game selects a random word from a word list and makes that the secret word
  
  * The player guesses one letter at a time, trying to figure out what the word is
  
  * If the player guesses correctly, any instances of that letter are revealed in the secret word
  
  * If the player guesses incorrectly, they are penalized by taking away a guess
  
  * If a player reveals all of the letters of the secret word, they win
  
  * If a player makes 8 incorrect guesses before solving the secret word, they lose

* Complete a Learning Log for this week if you haven't already. Suggestions:
  * Javascript objects
  * ES6 syntax
  * Javascript callback functions
