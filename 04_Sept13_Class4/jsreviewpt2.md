### Callback functions
Javascript is frequently **asynchronous**. This means that multiple things can be happening at once, and that code is NOT ALWAYS executed in the order that its written in.

For example, the ```setTimeout``` function will execute a chunk of code after a certain amount of time elapses. It takes two parameters: one, a function to execute, two the amount of time to wait before executing. Here are two ways of writing the same thing:

```javascript

function sayHi() {
	alert("Hi");
}

setInterval(sayHi, 1000); // call sayHi() after one second.


// do that same thing, but with an "anonymous" (unnamed function) instead
setInterval(function(){
	alert("Hi!!");
}, 1000);
```

Notice how in that second example we just stick a whole function definition inside the call to setInterval. This is a pattern you will see and use all the time.

For example, in DOM event listeners.

```javascript
document.body.addEventListener("click", function(e) {
	alert("You clicked on the page");
});
```

## Objects

Objects are key/value pairs. The keys are string-like, and the values can be anything.

```javascript
var person = {}; // an empty object

// declaring an object with some values
var person = {
	firstName: "Sarah",
	lastName: "Dahnke"
}

// access a value
person.firstName // returns "Sarah"

// another way to access a value
person["firstName"]

// modify an existing value, or create a new one:
person.firstName = "Sarah Rose";

person.gender = "Female";

// stick a an array in there
person.favoriteBooks = ["Moby Dick", "The Man Without Qualities", "Magic Mountain", "War and Peace"]

// stick another object in there
person.computer = {
	brand: "Mac",
	model: "Air",
	year: 2017
};

// stick a function in there
person.getFullName = function() {
	return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
}

person.getFullName(); // returns a string with Sarah Rose Dahnke
```

Notice how we can define an object and then after add properties to it that include arrays, other objects and functions. If we were to define this object all in one go, it would look like this:

```javascript
var person = {
	firstName: "Sarah",
	lastName: "Dahnke",
	gender: "female",
	
	favoriteBooks: ["Moby Dick", "The Man Without Qualities", "Magic Mountain", "War and Peace"],
	
	computer: {
		brand: "Mac",
		model: "Air",
		year: 2017
	},
	
	getFullName: function() {
		return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
	}
}

```
NOTE: don't forget to put a ```,``` after each value or your code will break.


### Object Oriented Programming
Javascript doesn't exactly have classes. ANY function can act as a constructor function when you use the ```new``` keyword.

```javascript
function Person(firstName, lastName) {
	this.firstName = firstName;
	this.lastName = lastName;
}

var name = new Person("Sarah", "Dahnke");
sam.firstName // returns "Sarah"
```

It can be convenient to create objects this way when need multiple objects that all behave the same way.

To add methods to our class, we use the following syntax:

```javascript
Person.prototype.getFullName = function() {
	return this.firstName + " " + this.lastName;
}

var name = new Person("Sarah Dahnke");
console.log(name.getFullName()); //returns the string from our getFullname function: "Sarah Rose Dahnke"
```

## Scope
a quick note on scope: variables exist with the function that they are declared, NOT with pairs of braces like other languages. SO:

```javascript
function whatever() {
	if (1 == 1) {
		var hello = true;
	}
	console.log(hello); // prints true
}
console.log(hello) //undefined!


// apartmentTwo will have access to things declared in apartmentOne, but not the other way around.
function apartmentOne() {
	var iLiveInOne = true;
	function apartmentTwo() {
		var iLiveInTwo = true;
		console.log(iLiveInOne) // prints true!
	}
	console.log(iLiveInTwo) // undefined
}

```

## What is "this"?
You may have noticed that in the object examples we used the ```this``` keyword. ```this``` can be a difficult concept to explain. I think the best way of looking at it is as **context**. If you use ```this``` within an object method, ```this``` will equal the object itself. If you use ```this``` outside an object method, ```this``` will equal the global or window context.

It can become very confusing because ```this``` will sometimes NOT be what you are expecting. We'll come back to this topic at a later date!
