## Day 16

* Learning Log: Miranda

* HI ARE WE ALL CONFUSED ABOUT EXPRESS VIEWS YET? We're going to fix that.

    a) Let's back up and talk about what a template is for.
    
    b) Then we'll simply compile and render the time/date.
    
    c) Then we'll pass a single string from the server to the view.
    
    d) THEN we'll iterate over that object from Tuesday's exercise and pass it to the view.
    
* But we're not done yet. Let's add a form to the equation.

### Homework

Now it's your turn! 

Using the API of your choice, build a lightweight Express app that allows for user input that retrieves data from the API. (Example: Our weather app that allowed the user to type in the name of a city into a form and retrieve the weather for that city.)

Push your app to Github with a README that tells the user step-by-step how to install and run the app locally. Make sure your app includes a .gitignore file that ignores your node_modules and config file (if you have one). DO NOT PUSH CODE THAT INCLUDES YOUR API KEY!

Submit a link to your repo on NYU Classes under Assignment #6.
